Larry Kudlow weighs in on Trump Tax Plan - http:// go.shr.lc/2fQLpCZ via @spartareport
@larry_ kudlow @taxfoundation How many vote Democrats? Just desserts?
@larry_ kudlow Mr Kudlow , do U know why consumer discretionary and staple stocks like CLX are getting destroyed the past 5 months?
@larry_ kudlow @taxfoundation ok, let's give them a big tax cut! No tax cut for anyone else. That's the way you seem to want it!
@Freedomzone_ @larry_ kudlow @taxfoundation Restated , why target 1%. Make investment here attractive. Penalizing ppl nvr works. Always avoid
Larry Kudlow weighs in on Trump Tax Plan https://www. spartareport.com/2016/12/larry- kudlow-weighs-trump-tax-plan/ …
@Oil_vampire @larry_ kudlow @taxfoundation I know what the point is. Tks.
@Freedomzone_ @larry_ kudlow @taxfoundation and wasteful. Point is whether 1% or 99% let the ppl and markets determine flow/use of wealth
@Oil_vampire @larry_ kudlow @taxfoundation Because that is what this thread is talking about.
@Freedomzone_ @larry_ kudlow @taxfoundation closest to point of use best able to make effective use determine who gets what. Gov ineffective
@Freedomzone_ @larry_ kudlow @taxfoundation why single them out? Econ principles apply to all. From charity to capital allocation those
@larry_ kudlow @ScottNations @taxfoundation Why do you view paying taxes punishment? Perhaps civic duty to contribute?
@Oil_vampire @larry_ kudlow @taxfoundation I am talking about 1%.
@larry_ kudlow @taxfoundation as opposed to making the middle-income who are struggling and lower-income pay?
@britneyfansher @boostychrystal You know who this reminds me of?
@larry_ kudlow Source? http:// cbo.gov has top 1% at 25.4% 2013 share. All taxes do you mean just federal not regressive S&L?
@larry_ kudlow @taxfoundation I heard somewhere that it was 50%, but I agree. Don't punish success.
@larry_ kudlow @taxfoundation No punishments. But these taxpayers do not need a tax cut. Need tax cut for bottom of the economic spectrum.

@JChiefElk @larry_ kudlow @taxfoundation In a free market there shouldn't be bailouts. But also there shouldn't be punishing success
@larry_ kudlow @taxfoundation well, to reward in-success, of course #ymcasoccerparticipationtrophy

@larry_ kudlow @taxfoundation Because the Libs and Progressives believe the wealthy are taking advantage of the "little guy."
@JimPethokoukis has really lost his way... @larry_ kudlow , please help him #carrier
@steveliesman Do you think that is advice from Mr Free Market - Larry Kudlow ?
@Freedomzone_ @larry_ kudlow @taxfoundation ppl are responsive. Look at go fund me and charity overall. If ppl kept more they would give more
@larry_ kudlow @newsmax Please get Bernie Sanders to listen to your show..
@Freedomzone_ @larry_ kudlow @taxfoundation sieze all offshore accts, Gov could spend them in 90 days. Taxing is not the prob, spending is
@Freedomzone_ @larry_ kudlow @taxfoundation small ball compared to hundreds of trillions promised by gov they have to take from someone.
@Oil_vampire @larry_ kudlow @taxfoundation Wonder who belongs to all those 100's of billions in offshore tax havens?
@larry_ kudlow @taxfoundation No tax fairness until we address wasteful spending. Outrageous growth in fed spending outpaces wage growth.
@larry_ kudlow @taxfoundation no Larry. You are forgetting payroll taxes.
@larry_ kudlow @taxfoundation @AriFleischer .....Obama wants to punish successful folks...remember this "after all how much do u really need"
@Freedomzone_ @larry_ kudlow @taxfoundation In the end the consumer ends up paying bulk of taxes. Middle hit when they earn/when they spend
@larry_ kudlow @newsmax and the rich get richer and the country goes further in debt. Not so smart
@Freedomzone_ @larry_ kudlow @taxfoundation Probably so small be insignificant. Libs know taxing middle even in hidden ways generates max rev
@larry_ kudlow @taxfoundation Larry glad to see you are involved in advising the President Elect. Can you come dig us out from under Trudeau
@larry_ kudlow @taxfoundation What ℅ of the top 1℅ paid little to no income tax?
@larry_ kudlow rich people hoard money and collect interest. Unproductive use of excess capital..put money into the hands of those who spend
@Delta__Neutral @larry_ kudlow Yea they invest it generally as well as spending it. Not many burying it in the yard.
@larry_ kudlow @taxfoundation Not a degreed economist but even i can see taxing a lot of ppl a little can generate more than taxing few a lot
@larry_ kudlow @taxfoundation it is not punishment to pay taxes. Ours a progressive tax system and those who make the most pay the most.
@larry_ kudlow Larry "rich" people don't spend money. The 99% spend 80-120% of their income AND make this economy rip. Do you not get that?
@larry_ kudlow @taxfoundation Success,from a bailout,isthe equivalent of being awarded a trophy for taking 11th place. Welfare Recipients.
@larry_ kudlow @taxfoundation paid
@larry_ kudlow @taxfoundation Larry! You know the answer! Envy and elitism! The Democratic Party is a den of vipers!
@larry_ kudlow @taxfoundation If they're a investment banker that received a bailout thats not success.
@larry_ kudlow @taxfoundation because they own 95% of the wealth. We tax work not wealth.
@JimPethokoukis nice man U. R. Off base on Carrier Jobs. If Kudlow likes U, I like U.
Did you know that top 1% taxpayers payed 38% of all taxes in 2013. They earned 19% of AGI, Why punish success? Mike Solon. @taxfoundation

@larry_ kudlow @CNBC do you think Trump should look at sarbanes oxley now that dot-bomb crash is far off in rear view mirror?
@CNBC - I really wanted to hear what your regular guys wanted to say. Please keep Larry Kudlow off the show.
@SullyCNBC Brian, Larry Kudlow @larry_ kudlow wants to go back to BOOM & BUST cycles. Too much business investment will eventually go BUST

Hey @SullyCNBC , how come #Kudlow acts like he knows everything till @BarneyFrank shows-up, & then #Larry doesn't seem to know anything ?
@larry_ kudlow People are more interested in a level playing field and shared sacrifices vs tax code simplification.
In comparison, BHO saved GM jobs by taking it and giving to union. Lawful action: bankruptcy. @mitchellvii @BoSnerdley @larry_ kudlow https:// twitter.com/traceytheisen/ status/803851945089835008 …

#PowerLunch Kudlow insist we want simplification! He's wrong, we want a level playing field.
@PowerLunch Fmr. Senator Frank defends Dodd-Frank with the facts and leaves MCC and Kudlow speechless. Nothing in the law deters lending!!
